# this repo will be using lanflow and langfuse to trace embedding and llm interaction constructing a flow of logic in order to get some job done by ai agents
# I believe that mini ai agents will be future for people who want to have automated task done at a micro level and to replace some human tasks by decomposing what make
# those job position or flow of tasks and getting mini agents fulfilling the requests to completely automate the process.
